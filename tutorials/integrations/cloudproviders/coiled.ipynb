    "# Coiled\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue works perfectly well with [Coiled](https://coiled.io/). This document assumes you already have Coiled service setup and you know the basic operations on Coiled. If that is not the case, please create an account on Coiled (with free credits) and setup AWS or GCP according to their instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start from the pre-built Docker image\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start trying is to run the docker environment locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 8888:8888 -it fugueproject/coiled:latest jupyter lab --port=8888 --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password='' --NotebookApp.allow_origin='*'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should access the JupyterLab environment by `http://localhost:8888` in your browser. When you are in JupyterLab, the first thing is to log in into Coiled. You may start a terminal in the lab environment and type\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "coiled login\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or just follow the official [instruction](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/configuration.html) to setup your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can start a new notebook. The first step is to create a software environment in Coiled. For example, you can run the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import coiled\n",
    "\n",
    "SOFTWARE_ENV = os.environ[\"DOCKER_IMAGE\"].replace(\"/\",\"_\").replace(\":\",\"_\").replace(\".\",\"_\")\n",
    "coiled.create_software_environment(name=SOFTWARE_ENV, container=os.environ[\"DOCKER_IMAGE\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing is the container is better to be the same as what you are on, which ensures version consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "To start from scratch, you must make sure the coiled cloud provider dependency is installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install fugue-cloudprovider[coiled]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides that you also need to make sure your worker environment has matching packages and python version. **You must also install fugue on the worker side.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Fugue on Coiled\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you already have a Coiled cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "You may follow the [official doc](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/cluster.html) or your own way to create a `Cluster` instance, assuming it is `cluster`. Then `cluster` can be used as the execution engine directly, for example:"
